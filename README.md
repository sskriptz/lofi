Calm relaxing place tab to chill in:
 - Comes with an in-built audio player that comes with different sorts of music
 - Add particle effects to the webpage
 - Change the background image

Future Plans:
 - Allow the user to change the background image with their own custom url
 - Add ambient sounds
 - Upgrade audio player to have more features
 - Add a tasks panel to list things you want to get done (Along with an in-built timer that will pause the music once the timer goes off)
 - Add multiple website themes to select from
 - Somehow find a way to enable cookies to save user preferences
